âœ¨ I'm a Information System's student at UFMG (Brazil) and a software development inter. I worky mainly with front-end but my goal is to became a Software Engineer working with both front-end and back-end.

I love share my knowledge with others and learn about pretty much anything new. On my free time I like to read, watch movies and spend time with my family and friends.
