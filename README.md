âœ¨ I'm a Information System's student at UFMG (Brazil) and a software development intern. I have experience working in a startup as a Full stack developer and I'm always looking to learn more and improve my skills. Make life easier and create tools that can really change the world are what I'm most excited about being a developer.
  
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with ReactJS, Nodejs and React Native ...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently deepening front-end studies ... I'm also studing C#, .Net and some infrastructure concepts ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm addicted to mystery books ...
